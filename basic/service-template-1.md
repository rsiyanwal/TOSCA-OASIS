 This TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) service template defines the deployment of several components in a fog computing setup. It has several nodes:

 - "outdoor-node" and "indoor-node": nodes of type "tosca.nodes.Compute" with private and public addresses specified
 - "docker-swarm-leader": node of type "fog.docker.SwarmLeader" hosted on the "indoor-node"
 - "docker-swarm-worker": node of type "fog.docker.SwarmWorker" hosted on the "outdoor-node" and connected to the "docker-swarm-leader"
 - "broker-service": node of type "fog.docker.Services" with a specified name and URL, hosted on the "docker-swarm-leader" and dependent on the "docker-swarm-worker"
 - "sensor-data-publisher": node of type "fog.docker.Containers" with a specified name and URL, hosted on the "outdoor-node" and dependent on the "broker-service"
 - "actuator-data-subscriber": node of type "fog.docker.Containers" with a specified name and URL, hosted on the "indoor-node" and dependent on the "broker-service".

These nodes form a fog computing system with components for data processing, management and communication.

- "tosca.nodes.Compute" is a type of node in TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) that represents a computing resource, 
such as a server or a virtual machine, that can be used to run applications. This type of node is used to define the resources needed to run an application 
and the relationships between these resources. The "tosca.nodes.Compute" type can have attributes such as private and public addresses, which are specified 
in this template, and these attributes can be used to describe the characteristics of the computing resource. This type of node is a fundamental component 
of TOSCA, and is used in various scenarios to define the resources needed to run a cloud application.

- "fog.docker.SwarmLeader" is a type of node in TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) that represents a leader node in a Docker Swarm, which is a native clustering solution for Docker. A Docker Swarm allows multiple Docker nodes to join together and work as a single virtual system. The leader node is responsible for managing the swarm and coordinating the work of other nodes in the swarm. In the TOSCA service template you provided, the "fog.docker.SwarmLeader" node is hosted on the "indoor-node". This means that the leader node in the Docker Swarm will be run on the computing resource represented by the "indoor-node". The "fog.docker.SwarmLeader" node is one of the components in the fog computing system described in the template, and it is used to manage the Docker Swarm that is part of this system.
